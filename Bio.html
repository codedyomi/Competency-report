    <h3>Biography</h3>

    <p class="blue-bg text">I am from Nigeria West Africa. I travelled to the USA via <b>Los Angeles</b> for the first time in the month of October of the year<i>2015</i>. Currently I am learning the full-stack web developer program at San Diego Global Knowledge University, because I want to use this knowledge to add more skills to my resume and <del>hopefully</del> use it to work with <mark>IT</mark> team members who will collaborate with me to create well designed website projects. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="yellow-bg text">In year 2009 I graduated from The University of Abuja Nigeria with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and I was appointed a trade promotions officer for Nigerian Export Promotion Council on 20<sup>th.</sup> of Decenber 2012. My duties as a trade promotions officer exposed me to theory and practices of international trade. I learned that one must continue to add value to himself in order to be able to compete in a world where disruptive technology is changing how we do business and communicate, on the daily basis. I am open to learning new technology applications such that I can be able to apply the applicable technology that is useful to any business venture project.

    <p>I have been living in Southern California since my arrival in 2015 I love the weather in this part of the country and its similar to what is obtainable in many parts of Africa. I do not like to live in Canada for example because of the snow and very cold weather out there. I like visiting the warm beaches in San Diego county. I prefer to write water with its chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I have been living in San Diego California before the <small>onset</small> of the Corona virus pandemic, I think moving to <ins>southern california</ins> was a good idea, <b><em>because</em></b> <em>I know I can be what I want to be</em> and I just need to work hard at achieving my goals and i will get to where I want to be in life.
